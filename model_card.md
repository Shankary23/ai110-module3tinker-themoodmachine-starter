# Model Card: Mood Machine

This model card is for the Mood Machine project, which includes **two** versions of a mood classifier:

1. A **rule based model** implemented in `mood_analyzer.py`
2. A **machine learning model** implemented in `ml_experiments.py` using scikit learn

You may complete this model card for whichever version you used, or compare both if you explored them.

## 1. Model Overview

**Model type:**  
Describe whether you used the rule based model, the ML model, or both.  

 - Only used the rule based model, since training a model   would take longer but would be more effective at handling the edge cases like sarcasm.

**Intended purpose:**  
What is this model trying to do?  
Example: classify short text messages as moods like positive, negative, neutral, or mixed.

- This model is trying to classify captions with positive or negative feelings, based on the words and phrasing.

**How it works (brief):**  
For the rule based version, describe the scoring rules you created.  
For the ML version, describe how training works at a high level (no math needed).

- The rule-based model tokenizes input text (lowercase, split on spaces, punctuation stripped) and scans each token against two word lists: POSITIVE_WORDS and NEGATIVE_WORDS. Each positive word match adds +1 to the score; each negative word match subtracts 1.

    - Two additional rules improve accuracy:

        - Negation handling — if a negation word (e.g. "not", "never", "don't") immediately precedes a sentiment word, the contribution is flipped (e.g. "not happy" scores -1 instead of +1).

        - Sarcasm detection — if the text contains at least one positive word alongside a known sarcasm trigger word (e.g. "stuck", "traffic", "terrible"), the score is forced negative, catching phrases like "I love getting stuck in traffic."

        - The final score is mapped to a label: positive (> 0), negative (< 0), or neutral (== 0).


## 2. Data

**Dataset description:**  
Summarize how many posts are in `SAMPLE_POSTS` and how you added new ones.

**Labeling process:**  
Explain how you chose labels for your new examples.  
Mention any posts that were hard to label or could have multiple valid labels.

**Important characteristics of your dataset:**  
Examples you might include:  

- Contains slang or emojis  
- Includes sarcasm  
- Some posts express mixed feelings  
- Contains short or ambiguous messages

**Possible issues with the dataset:**  
Think about imbalance, ambiguity, or missing kinds of language.

## 3. How the Rule Based Model Works (if used)

**Your scoring rules:**  
Describe the modeling choices you made.  
Examples:  

- How positive and negative words affect score  
- Negation rules you added  
- Weighted words  
- Emoji handling  
- Threshold decisions for labels

**Strengths of this approach:**  
Where does it behave predictably or reasonably well?

**Weaknesses of this approach:**  
Where does it fail?  
Examples: sarcasm, subtlety, mixed moods, unfamiliar slang.

## 4. How the ML Model Works (if used)

**Features used:**  
Describe the representation.  
Example: “Bag of words using CountVectorizer.”

**Training data:**  
State that the model trained on `SAMPLE_POSTS` and `TRUE_LABELS`.

**Training behavior:**  
Did you observe changes in accuracy when you added more examples or changed labels?

**Strengths and weaknesses:**  
Strengths might include learning patterns automatically.  
Weaknesses might include overfitting to the training data or picking up spurious cues.

## 5. Evaluation

**How you evaluated the model:**  
Both versions can be evaluated on the labeled posts in `dataset.py`.  
Describe what accuracy you observed.

**Examples of correct predictions:**  
Provide 2 or 3 examples and explain why they were correct.

**Examples of incorrect predictions:**  
Provide 2 or 3 examples and explain why the model made a mistake.  
If you used both models, show how their failures differed.

## 6. Limitations

Describe the most important limitations.  
Examples:  

- The dataset is small  
- The model does not generalize to longer posts  
- It cannot detect sarcasm reliably  
- It depends heavily on the words you chose or labeled

## 7. Ethical Considerations

Discuss any potential impacts of using mood detection in real applications.  
Examples: 

- Misclassifying a message expressing distress  
- Misinterpreting mood for certain language communities  
- Privacy considerations if analyzing personal messages

## 8. Ideas for Improvement

List ways to improve either model.  
Possible directions:  

- Add more labeled data  
- Use TF IDF instead of CountVectorizer  
- Add better preprocessing for emojis or slang  
- Use a small neural network or transformer model  
- Improve the rule based scoring method  
- Add a real test set instead of training accuracy only
